Ever since I first watched Clueless as a kid, whenever I've been stuck on picking an outfit I end up remembering the the outfit picker that Cher uses. 
This outfit picker is a simpler version that hopefully will help you generate and choose an outfit. Currently it works as follows:
- users can upload photos of their clothes to the corresponding catergory in their virtual wardrobe (the images folder given has example image files)
- current catergories are: tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, shoes, hats, bags.
- outfits are randomly generated, however the items will always be compatible so user will not end up with a dress and pants + top combination
- if the current outfit isn't giving, generate another instantly!

I woud like to continue improving my outfit generators functionality by implementing these ideas in the future:
- allow users to remove items from wardrobe instead of having to generate another outfit without it
- add an option to select the weather/temperature for that day which then will mean in the logic certain clothing items will/will not be selcted so the outfit
  is appropriate for that day
- add a manneuin figure or an option to add a photo of yourself so that the clothing items can be overlaid over you so you're getting 'dressed'
- add button or some feature so that users can switch an items catergory after upload in case they picked the wrong option
